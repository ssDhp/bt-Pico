- Refactor


![v2 image](/img/imagev2.jpg)
GPS Tracker updates its location on the website [here](https://mg-lsj.github.io/Bus-Tracker/).

### Components used:

- Raspberry Pi Pico (Microcontroller): Controls other two modules
- NEO-6M (GPS module): Gets current location
- SIM800L (GSM/GPRS module): Sends location to the website

### How to setup this project?

1. Install this [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulober.pico-w-go).
2. Open the `project's scripts` folder in VS Code
3. Open command pallete by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`
4. Run this command. `Pico-W-Go > Configure Project`
5. Done.

### Hardware Checks

Check LEDs on modules to see if modules are working correctly  
**NOTE:** Startup process can take upto a minute or more.

1. NEO-6M  
   This modules takes 30 - 45 seconds to startup in the best case.
   - No blinking - Searching for satellites
   - Blink every 1 second - Position fix found (Module can "see" enough satelittes).
2. SIM800L  
   For this module startup takes around 30 seconds.
   - Blink every 1s - Module is seaching for a network
   - Blink every 2s - Data connection is active
   - Blink every 3s - Module is connected to a network and can receive/send

Now, run `test_connections.py` to check connections.
